# ghLibraryJs README

### What? ###

* _Summary_: This "ghLibraryJs" git repository is public and contains some JavaScript utility code that I've used over the years. It focuses on language-level items and should not change from site-to-site. Much of it should be deprecated but why throw away code?
* _Language_: JavaScript.
* _Version_: 2017-06-15.

### Who? ###
* _Authors_: George Hernandez (gh@georgehernandez.com).
* _Licensing_: Public. Free: _gratis_ (as in beer) and _libre_ (as in speech). I  have referenced code inspirational source as much as possible.
